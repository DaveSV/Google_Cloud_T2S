The Jewish populace seems too busy confronting themselves to realize that there is a shidduch tragedy before them. All are engaged in the I am Frummer (more religious) Than Thou Game.

Yes, the chess game of the Jewish people does exist and it consists of numerous players including Kings, Queens, Pawns and Knights.

Let us analyze these players. The Kings and Queens are found everywhere. They are better known as the Better Than Thou contingency representing, with nose held high, the so-called super machmir (stringent), whose main function in life is to supervise and interpret the motives of others.

And J.A.P., a term which applies equally to both sexes, reigns supreme. A true J.A.P. is one whose real emotions and feelings of dedication and idealism are hidden under the heavy burden of appeasing self-righteous motives. Is it any wonder that some young Jewish singles seek elsewhere?

And let us not forget the elite, the Yechis (heredity status) Seekers. Remember my son, you belong to a righteous family; avoid the Baal Tshuvah (a non-observant Jew who became religious), after all they may change their ways and go back to what they once were. Remember who you are and where you came from.

And if these were not sufficient, the Kings and Queens engage themselves in the I am Glatter than thou pageant.â€™ This requires the ability to openly criticize others regarding their mode of dress, their eating patterns, the collor of their Shabbat tablecloths, and the opinion that recognized certified Kosher products are not acceptable. The fictitious Glatt pickle is preferred, and, of course, an open attack against religious leaders' decisions, their ammunition being some new chumrah (strict legal view) entitles one to acquire membership in this select group. The only problem is that no one wants to be a follower and thus the leaders continue quoting profound statements found in the tractate Buba Meisah (fairy tales).
