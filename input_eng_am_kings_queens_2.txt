Now, the heroic Knight enters the arena. This individual, male or female, traditionally minded and filled with the love of Torah, wages an heroic campaign. The Knights are represented by clergy and lay leadership who open their hearts to Jewish young people communicating the love and harmony of the Torah. Numerous Rabbis are fighting on the front lines to create a vibrant Jewish community. Young people are engaged in Shabbatonim, retreats and seminars in an active attempt to spread Yiddishkeit and meet one another; yet, too often, Jewish organizations seem more interested in the establishment of plush swimming pools than in financing such activities (or even religious projects such as a community mikvah,ritual bath).

These Knights, however are confronted by numerous foes. Rabbis are challenged by the Glatt contingent whose main battle cry seems to be “The Mechitzah (separation between men and women in the synagogue sanctuary) is not high enough.”

Why is there a Shidduch crises? Perhaps it is because in the chess game of life, it is the PAWN who suffers the most.

The Torah holds the answers to all our questions; however, human beings, with God’s help, are needed to overcome so called obstacles.

If only we, the pursuers of Torah knowledge, would realize that the battle is immense and the time is short. Instead of playing the Glatt Game called “Frummer than Thou,” let us communicate love and knowledge , let us act in the image of God; only then will we be worthy to be called Frum Yidden who walk in the “Glatt path”. In the words of Rav Kook, “Just at the Second Temple was destroyed by acts of brotherly hatred, the third Temple will be built by acts of brotherly Love.”

Let's give our young adults a chance!
